# üì´ Project Overview - Weather Prediction in SG With Python And Machine Learning (Inspired by Dataquest Tutorial)

In this project, I predicted tomorrow's temperature using historical data. Started by downloading a dataset of local weather. You can customize this to your own location. Then, cleaned the data and get it ready for machine learning. Built a system to make historical predictions. Then, addrd more predictors to improve the model. Ending with how to make next-day predictions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Code

You can find the code for this project [here](https://github.com/zzhengweii/weather-prediction)

File overview:

- `predict.ipynb` - predict the temperature
